## What It Is

GroundTruth is an MCP server that gives AI coding agents codebase intelligence -- for any language. It indexes source code into a SQLite call graph, then provides evidence-based briefings, validation, and symbol tracing to prevent hallucinations.

**How it works:**
1. `gt-index` (Go binary) parses source code with tree-sitter, extracts functions/classes/calls/imports, writes `graph.db`
2. MCP server reads `graph.db` and exposes 16 tools (trace, hotspots, symbols, explain, etc.)
3. `gt_intel.py` (evidence engine) queries `graph.db` for SWE-bench evaluation

**Works with any MCP client:** Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Windsurf.

## Architecture

```
Source code (any language)
       |
       v
gt-index (Go binary, tree-sitter)
  - 30 language specs
  - 6 with import extractors (Python, Go, JS, TS, Java, Rust)
  - 24 with name-match fallback
  - Edge confidence scoring (1.0=verified, 0.2=ambiguous)
  - Edge deduplication
       |
       v
graph.db (SQLite)
  - nodes: functions, classes, methods
  - edges: calls with resolution_method + confidence
       |
       +---> MCP server (16 tools via FastMCP, stdio)
       |       Agent calls groundtruth_trace, groundtruth_hotspots, etc.
       |
       +---> gt_intel.py (SWE-bench evidence engine)
       |       7 evidence families, fully deterministic
       |
       +---> groundtruth resolve (LSP precision pass, diagnostic)
               Shows ambiguous edges, detects installed LSP servers

## graph.db Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE nodes (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    label TEXT NOT NULL,        -- 'Function', 'Method', 'Class', 'Interface', etc.
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    qualified_name TEXT,
    file_path TEXT NOT NULL,
    start_line INTEGER,
    end_line INTEGER,
    signature TEXT,
    return_type TEXT,
    is_exported BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0,
    is_test BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0,
    language TEXT NOT NULL,
    parent_id INTEGER REFERENCES nodes(id)
);

CREATE TABLE edges (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    source_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES nodes(id),
    target_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES nodes(id),
    type TEXT NOT NULL,         -- 'CALLS', 'IMPORTS'
    source_line INTEGER,
    source_file TEXT,
    resolution_method TEXT,    -- 'same_file', 'import', 'name_match'
    confidence REAL DEFAULT 0.0,  -- 0.0-1.0 (v14+)
    metadata TEXT
);
```

### Edge Confidence Model

| Resolution Method | Confidence | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| same_file | 1.0 | Caller and callee in same file |
| import | 1.0 | Verified via import statement |
| name_match (1 candidate) | 0.9 | Only one function with this name exists |
| name_match (2 candidates) | 0.6 | Two possible targets |
| name_match (3-5 candidates) | 0.4 | Several possible targets |
| name_match (5+ candidates) | 0.2 | Highly ambiguous |

Evidence engine filters edges below MIN_CONFIDENCE (0.5) to prevent false positives.

## Go Indexer (gt-index)

### 4-Pass Architecture

1. **STRUCTURE** -- Walk filesystem, discover source files by language
2. **DEFINITIONS + IMPORTS** -- Parallel tree-sitter parse (NumCPU workers), batch SQLite insert
3. **CALLS** -- Resolve call references via 3-stage pipeline, compute confidence, deduplicate
4. **EXTRAS** -- Store metadata (build time, file count, workers, etc.)

### 3-Stage Resolution Pipeline

1. **Same-file** (confidence=1.0) -- callee name matches a definition in the same file
2. **Import-verified** (confidence=1.0) -- caller file imports callee name, resolved via file map
3. **Name-match** (confidence=0.2-0.9) -- fallback, matches by name across all files

### Language Support

**Tier 1 (import extractors):** Python, Go, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Rust
**Tier 2 (name-match only):** 24 additional languages via tree-sitter specs

### Building

```bash
# Requires Go 1.22+ and GCC (CGO needed for go-sqlite3)
cd gt-index
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -o gt-index ./cmd/gt-index/

# Usage
gt-index -root /path/to/repo -output graph.db
```

## Evidence Engine (gt_intel.py)

### 7 Evidence Families

| Family | Score | What It Produces |
|---|---|---|
| IMPORT | 2 | Correct import paths for cross-file callees |
| CALLER | 1-3 | Cross-file callers with usage classification |
| SIBLING | 1-3 | Behavioral norms from same-class methods |
| TEST | 1-2 | Test functions with assertions |
| IMPACT | 1-2 | Blast radius (caller count + critical path) |
| TYPE | 1-2 | Return type contracts |
| PRECEDENT | 2 | Last git commit touching this function |

### Output Format

```xml
<gt-evidence>
[VERIFIED] CAUTION: 3 callers in 2 files (0.67)
[WARNING] MUST return Optional[User] (0.33)
</gt-evidence>
```

Tiers: `[VERIFIED]` = confidence >= 0.9, `[WARNING]` = 0.5-0.9, `[INFO]` = < 0.5

### Usage

```bash
# Post-edit reminder
gt_intel.py --db=graph.db --file=src/users.py --function=get_user --reminder

# Pre-task briefing
gt_intel.py --db=graph.db --enhanced-briefing --issue-text="fix auth bug"
```

## Coding Standards

- Python 3.11+. Type hints. `mypy --strict`.
- Pydantic for data models. `structlog` for logging.
- `pytest` + `pytest-asyncio`. In-memory SQLite for unit tests.
- `ruff` for linting + formatting.
- Go 1.22+. `go-sqlite3` (CGO). `go-tree-sitter`.
- All SQLite queries use parameterized statements.
- Update PROGRESS.md after every milestone.

---

## Known Limitations

1. **70-80% of edges are name_match** on large repos -- confidence scoring mitigates but doesn't eliminate false positives
2. **Large repo indexing is slow** -- 78-136 min for 14K+ file repos
3. **Tier 2 languages** have no import resolution -- edges are speculative
4. **gt-resolve** is diagnostic only in v1.0.0 -- live LSP resolution is planned
5. **GraphStore bridge** is read-only -- Go indexer owns writes

---

## What NOT to Build

- No vector embeddings (FTS5 + graph queries are sufficient)
- No VS Code extension (MCP is universal)
- No web dashboard
- No daemon process (MCP stdio)
- No custom LSP server (we're a CLIENT)

## TTD Definition

TTD means Test-Trace-Driven debugging for GroundTruth benchmark plumbing.

In this project, TTD does NOT mean "write random unit tests."
It means:
- Start from a failed observed run artifact.
- Identify the exact trace/event/schema field that proves the failure.
- Write a behavior test that reproduces the reader/writer mismatch.
- Fix the writer, reader, or schema contract so the same artifact now passes.
- Only rerun smoke/canary after the test proves the failure mode is closed.

For the reference failure (smoke v5, 2026-04-24 06:18 UTC), the observed artifact is:
- raw counts show material_edit_total, ack_armed_total, steer_delivered_total, ack_engagement_total > 0
- verify_report still computes delivery_rate = 0.00 and engagement_rate = 0.00
- therefore this is a summary emission / rate denominator contract bug, not proof that steering was absent

Required TTD behavior:
- Do not classify a FAIL as a model behavior failure until the metric contract is proven correct.
- Do not rerun smoke as a substitute for fixing the metric contract.
- Add an end-to-end test that feeds a representative arm summary into verify_report and asserts nonzero delivery_rate / engagement_rate when the raw event chain is present.
- The test must fail before the fix and pass after the fix.

## Mandatory Analysis Rules

1. **NEVER claim "model failure" or "model stochasticity" as root cause.** If a task did not resolve, GT failed to deliver sufficient context. The model is frontier-class. Trace what context was missing or wrong. "Model behavior" is not a valid conclusion.

2. **NEVER claim any single evidence type (test assertions, callers, contracts, etc.) is THE lever for flips.** At this stage all evidence types are hypotheses under research. No evidence family is proven primary. If analysis suggests one type matters more, record it as secondary research to validate — do not build architecture around unproven claims.

3. **Context gap analysis is mandatory on every non-resolved task.** Compare: what did GT send vs what would the agent have needed to write the correct fix. The delta is the product bug.

## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, ALWAYS invoke it using the Skill
tool as your FIRST action. Do NOT answer directly, do NOT use other tools first.
The skill has specialized workflows that produce better results than ad-hoc answers.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas, "is this worth building", brainstorming → invoke office-hours
- Bugs, errors, "why is this broken", 500 errors → invoke investigate
- Ship, deploy, push, create PR → invoke ship
- QA, test the site, find bugs → invoke qa
- Code review, check my diff → invoke review
- Update docs after shipping → invoke document-release
- Weekly retro → invoke retro
- Design system, brand → invoke design-consultation
- Visual audit, design polish → invoke design-review
- Architecture review → invoke plan-eng-review
- Save progress, checkpoint, resume → invoke checkpoint
- Code quality, health check → invoke health
