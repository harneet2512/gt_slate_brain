"""GT-enabled SWE-bench eval task for Inspect AI.

Identical to the standard swe_bench task from inspect_evals EXCEPT:
- Adds gt_impact, gt_references, gt_check to the agent's tool list
- Adds a short system prompt explaining the GT tools
- Logs all GT tool calls to a JSONL file for observability

    You have access to GroundTruth codebase intelligence tools in addition to
    your standard tools. These help you understand code structure before making
    changes:

    - gt_impact(symbol): Shows what methods and sites share state with a symbol.
      Call this BEFORE editing a class to see all obligation sites you must cover.
    - gt_references(symbol): Shows where a symbol is defined and all files that
      use it. Faster than grep for finding all dependents.
    - gt_check(): After making edits, verifies your patch covers all obligation
      sites. Shows which sites you modified and which you missed.

    Use these tools when working on changes that affect class hierarchies,
    shared state, or cross-file dependencies. They are optional but help you
    write more complete patches.
