"""Classify a GT trace for regression autopsy.

This classifier answers: did the agent follow GT's steer, and was the steer
useful? It does NOT read any implementation internals of the hook or reporter.
It reads a frozen telemetry event stream and produces a classification dict.

The expected outputs are defined in tests/fixtures/trajectory/EXPECTED_BEHAVIOR.md,
derived from frozen artifacts before this code was written.
