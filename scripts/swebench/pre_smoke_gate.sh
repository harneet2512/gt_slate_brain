# Pre-smoke gate — must pass before any 10-task smoke is launched.
#
# These are BEHAVIOR tests, not implementation mirrors. Each one targets a
# real bug that previously shipped undetected and cost us a smoke run:
#
#   test_reporter_emits_hybrid_readiness    — caught the dormant gate
#   test_driver_propagates_lsp_env          — caught GT_LSP_ENABLED not
#                                              reaching the container
#   test_scraper_accepts_lsp_hybrid_label   — caught the arm-filter
#                                              rejecting gt-lsp-hybrid
#   test_gt_finalization_hybrid             — the readiness gate itself
#
# Usage (from repo root):
#   bash scripts/swebench/pre_smoke_gate.sh
#
# Exit code 0 means smoke is safe to launch. Non-zero means do NOT launch.
