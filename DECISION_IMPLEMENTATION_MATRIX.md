## Status Legend

- **VERIFIED** — Implementation matches intent, metrics confirm, no behavior change needed
- **IMPLEMENTED_AND_VERIFIED** — Fix applied and proven with metrics
- **PARTIAL_WITH_BLOCKER** — Implementation correct, awaiting external data
- **BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed (dependency missing)
- **STALE_SUPERSEDED** — Newer decision contradicts
- **CONTRADICTED** ��� Conflicts with another decision
- **ROLLED_BACK** — Implemented but reverted due to regression
- **NOT_STARTED** — Audit not yet begun
